                    <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Obesity, Age and Poverty.</h2>
                    <p>The analysis consisted on combining data from the US government census on all 50 states. The dataset had several health related information. The analysis was made trough building a scatter plot with D3, using tooltip and interactive
                        axis, that displayed the relationship between Obesity percentage and poverty, or according to Age, depending on the users choice.</p>

                    <p>When obesity is compared against Poverty percentage, there is an observed positive correlation between the two variables, which means that if a state's poverty percentage is high, is more likeli that the obesity rate will also be high,
                        excluding outliers (such as Washington DC). When we anlyse the states that have more than 18% poverty rate, the minimum obesity rate is of 28.4%.</p>

                    <p>As for the obesity relating to the Age of American citizens, according to the dataset analysed, is more likely that people with higher obesity rates have between 34 and 40 years old aproximatelly</p>
