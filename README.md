This repository is destined to hold files in order to display some of the main Data Analytical skills developed by me, Gustavo Garofalo, in the past couple of years.

Most of the skills displayed here were learned either by self studying or formal education, one of which is the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp, an intensive 24 week program offered by the University of Central Florida (Cerificate awarded in March 2020).

D3, standing for Data-Driven Documents, is a JavaScript library that allows the Data Analyst to produce dynamic and interactive visualizations in web browsers.

The skill displayed in this repository is D3.js.
